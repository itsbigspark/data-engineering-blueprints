## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of data pipeline design patterns, implementation examples, and best practices for building efficient, scalable, and maintainable data pipelines.

## Repository Structure

1. **dataflow-patterns**: Contains detailed explanations and examples of various data pipeline patterns.
   - extraction: Patterns for data extraction
   - behavioral: Patterns for different required pipeline behaviors
   - structural: Patterns for pipeline structure
   - source: Considerations for different source patterns
   - sink: Considerations for different sink patterns

2. **coding-patterns**: Includes coding best practices and helper functions for data pipeline development.
   - python-helpers: Python-specific patterns and utilities
   - scala-helpers: Scala-specific patterns and utilities
   

## Key Patterns

### Extraction Patterns

1. [Full Snapshot Pull](dataflow-patterns/extraction/full-snapshot-pull.md): Pull entire dataset at regular intervals.
2. [Streaming](dataflow-patterns/extraction/streaming.md): Process records in real-time or near real-time.
3. [Time Ranged Pull](dataflow-patterns/extraction/time-ranged-pull.md): Pull data for a specific time frame.
4. [Lookback Pull](dataflow-patterns/extraction/lookback-pull.md): Pull aggregate metrics for a past period.

### Behavioral Patterns

1. [Self-healing Pipelines](dataflow-patterns/behavioral/self-healing.md): Automatically recover from failures and process missed data.

### Structural Patterns

1. [Multi-hop Pipelines](dataflow-patterns/structural/multi-hop.md): Keep data separated at different levels of "cleanliness".
2. [Disconnected Pipelines](dataflow-patterns/structural/disconnected.md): Independent workflows with implicit dependencies.
3. [Conditional/Dynamic Pipelines](dataflow-patterns/structural/conditional.md): Adapt based on runtime conditions or inputs.

## Implementation Examples

The repository provides implementation examples in both Python and Scala. 

- [Python ETL Pipeline Example](dataflow-patterns/README.md#python-example)
- [Scala ETL Pipeline Example](dataflow-patterns/README.md#scala-example)

## Coding Best Practices

1. [Traits in Scala](coding-patterns/scala-helpers/traits.md): Powerful way to achieve multiple inheritance and compose behavior.
2. [Miscellaneous Tips](coding-patterns/misc.md): Additional tips and best practices for data pipeline development.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate through the `dataflow-patterns` directory to explore different patterns
3. Check the `coding-patterns` directory for best practices and helper functions
4. Refer to the implementation examples to understand how to apply these patterns in your projects

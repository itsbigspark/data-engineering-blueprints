# Decision-Making Blueprint

## Description
A flow chart to help choose the appropriate design pattern for a data pipeline based on various factors.

## Mermaid Diagram

B -->|No| D[Create Replayable Source];
C -->|Yes| E[Idempotent Pipeline];
C -->|No| F[Self-healing Pipeline];
D --> F;
F --> G[Multi-hop Architecture];
```

## Notes and References
- Decision-making blueprints guide the design process by providing a structured approach to choosing the most suitable pipeline architecture.
- Consider factors such as data volume, latency requirements, and system complexity when making decisions.
- The blueprint helps in identifying potential bottlenecks and challenges early in the design phase.
- Regularly revisit and update the blueprint as requirements and technologies evolve.
